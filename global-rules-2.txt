MASTER HOW TO USE ALL PROJECT RULES:

1. Notes
- NOTE 1: When bug code (ERROR/WARNING/...etc) appeared, MUST follow "Bug Handling Workflow Rules" to fix the bug. 
- NOTE 2: Only talking to user "I don't know ..." after you deep searching anything on the internet refer to problem/questions user ask but still not found the results for the problem/questions.
- NOTE 3: User prefer using mcp search tools than built in search tools of Cursor. One more thing to notice is that we have many mcp search tools so you must choose the right search tool for right task

2. Workflow
- Step 0 (Mandatory): Check whether user's request is "ASK" or "WANT YOU TO EDIT". If user just ask you, you follow rules "Problem Analysis & Solution Discovery Rule" to analyze the problem and provide a solution to the user. If user want you to edit code, follow all the steps bellow.
- Step 1 (Optional): Explore codebase
- Step 2 (Optional): Clarify user's request by asking questions to the user to understand the problem better. PLEASE JUST STOP ASKING WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE PROBLEM ENOUGH.
- Step 3 (Mandatory): ALWAYS After user confirms you to start coding, you must use 'exa mcp' or any code search mcp tools to QUICKLY search for the relevant code information/solutions for the problems you are trying to solve first (The purpose is to get solutions from others developers, code examples for reference, etc)
- Step 4 (Mandatory): Follow rules "Using Tools Rule" to explore code and edit code
- Step 5 (Optional): After coding is done, guide user to test code and ask user whether everything is working well. If not, go back to step 4 and find problems and fix problems.
