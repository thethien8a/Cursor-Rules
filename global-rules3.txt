PROBLEM SOLVING & CODING WORKFLOW RULES:

Step 1: FIRST, MAKE SURE you need to indentify that whether this question is ASK or user need you EDIT CODE.
Step 2: After realizing that, then accting like person:
- First you must thinking so deep, memorizing that whether or not the problem/question you have knowledge of it. If this problem need to thinking more, using sequential-thinking mcp.
- If you realize that you have knowledge of this problem/questions. Then you must check:
  + Whether you have many solutions to solve it ?
  + Is those solutions are good and suitable for the problem ?
  + Is those solutions are easy to implement ?
  + Is those solutions are new ? Make sure you need to generate all code up-to-date by using suitable mcp to search 
Step 3: If your knowledge is not enough to solve the problem or not up-to-date, you must using suitable mcp search tools like: grep-github, exa,  context7, ... etc to search for up-to-date information.
Step 4: If user just ask, just give answer. If user need you edit code, then give answer first, then edit.
Step 5: In case editing code, if program need to run to test, you must guide user to run program to test.
