EXPLORING CODEBASE RULE:
- Please always using serena-mcp to exploring codebase and investigating files in codebase. I prefer using serena-mcp tools to understand code than reading file or using subagents. Only reading file whenever you think that serena-mcp tool cannot help you to understand the code or when you really need to read file to do something. When using serena-mcp, you must activate the project first.
- Please if you can using parrallel tools call (using multiple tools in the same time), please using to increase speed. Especially when your task is reading or searching for something.
