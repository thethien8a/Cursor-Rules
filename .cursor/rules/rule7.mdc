# Coding Workflow Rule:

- Step 1 (Optional): Explore codebase (if you don't have information about the codebase, you must explore the codebase first)
- Step 2 (Optional): Clarify user's request by asking questions to the user to understand the problem better. PLEASE JUST STOP ASKING WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE PROBLEM ENOUGH.
- Step 3 (Mandatory): After user confirms you to start coding, you must use 'exa mcp' or any code search mcp tools to QUICKLY search for the relevant code information for the problems you are trying to solve first (The purpose is to get best practices  code from others developers for this task, code examples for reference, etc)
- Step 4 (Mandatory): Follow all others rules to exploring code and editing code
- Step 5 (Optional): After coding is done, guide user to test code and ask user whether everything is working well. If not, go back to step 4 and find problems and fix problems.

**NOTE:**: When bug appeared, must follow bug handling workflow rules to fix the bug
